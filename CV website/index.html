            <p>
                Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner.
                 The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).
                  Drifting is traditionally done by clutch kicking (where the clutch is rapidly disengaged and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting the grip of the rear wheels), then intentionally oversteering and countersteering. This sense of drift is not to be confused with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering technique established in Grand Prix and sports car racing.

                        Origin
                    </h2>
                    <p>Drifting originated in Japanese automobile racing. It was most popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races.
                         Famous motorcyclist turned driver Kunimitsu Takahashi was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires.
                          The bias-ply racing tires of the 1960sâ€“1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did street racers. </p>
                          <p></p>
                          <p></p>
                          <h2>Popularity</h2>
                     <p>One of the earliest recorded drift events outside Japan took place in 1996 at Willow Springs Raceway in Willow Springs, California, hosted by the Japanese drifting magazine and organization Option.
                          Daijiro Inada (founder of the Japanese D1 Grand Prix), the NHRA Funny Car drag racer Kenji Okazaki, and Keiichi Tsuchiya gave demonstrations in a Nissan 180SX that the magazine had brought over from Japan.
                           Entrants included Rhys Millen and Bryan Norris. </p>

                        Drift cars
                    </h2>
                    <p>Drift cars are usually light- to moderate-weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, offering a large range of power levels.
                         There have also been all-wheel drive cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as the Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis, Scion tC, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Dodge Charger, and Nissan GT-R.
                          Early on, AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually the rules allowed only a certain percentage of power to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.</p>

                        Drift competition
                    </h2>
                    <p> Judging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting.
                         The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, but it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner.
                          In tandem passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi); however, in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points. </p>
